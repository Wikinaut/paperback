this is a copy of Oleh Yuschuk's PaperBack application to backup data into images. Documentation and windows binary available at: http://ollydbg.de/Paperbak/

I'd like to get it working on GNU/Linux :)

PaperBack is a free application that allows you to back up your precious files on the ordinary paper in the form of the oversized bitmaps.
 If you have a good laser printer with the 600 dpi resolution, you can save up to 500,000 bytes of uncompressed data on the single A4/Letter sheet.
 Integrated packer allows for much better data density - up to 3,000,000+ (three megabytes) of C code per page.
